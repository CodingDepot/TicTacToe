# TicTacToe
A simple 2-Player-TicTacToe written in the flawless programming Language "[Rockstar](https://github.com/dylanbeattie/rockstar)".

This code tries to follow the spirit of Rockstar and aims to be as idiomatic as possible by being especially verbose and not including comments.
In a touch of inspiration the gibberish MAY be changed into more sensible "lyrics" over time.

The easiest way to try the code for yourself is by using the [online compiler](https://codewithrockstar.com/online). This however requires you to feed in all inputs at once (which in a way defeats the purpose of the program).

If you are interested in playing a real game of TicTacToe, preferably use [satriani](https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar/tree/main/satriani), the official intepreter.
