# TicTacToe
A simple 2-Player-TicTacToe written in the flawless programming Language "[Rockstar](https://codewithrockstar.com/)".

This code tries to follow the spirit of Rockstar by being especially verbose and not adding comments.
In a touch of inspiration the gibberish MAY be changed into more sensible "lyrics" over time.

The easiest way to try the code for yourself is by using the [online compiler](https://codewithrockstar.com/online).
